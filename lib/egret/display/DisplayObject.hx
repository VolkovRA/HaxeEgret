/**
 * The DisplayObject class is the base class for all objects that can be placed on the display list. The display list
 * manages all objects displayed in the runtime. Use the DisplayObjectContainer class to arrange the display
 * objects in the display list. DisplayObjectContainer objects can have child display objects, while other display objects,
 * such as Shape and TextField objects, are "leaf" nodes that have only parents and siblings, no children.
 * The DisplayObject class supports basic functionality like the x and y position of an object, as well as more advanced
 * properties of the object such as its transformation matrix.<br/>
 * The DisplayObject class contains several broadcast events.Normally, the target of any particular event is a specific
 * DisplayObject instance. For example, the target of an added event is the specific DisplayObject instance that was added
 * to the display list. Having a single target restricts the placement of event listeners to that target and in some cases
 * the target's ancestors on the display list. With broadcast events, however, the target is not a specific DisplayObject
 * instance, but rather all DisplayObject instances, including those that are not on the display list. This means that you
 * can add a listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for broadcast events.
 * 
 * @event Event.ADDED						Dispatched when a display object is added to the display list.
 * 
 * @event Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE				Dispatched when a display object is added to the on stage display list, either
 * 											directly or through the addition of a sub tree in which the display object is contained.
 * 
 * @event Event.REMOVED						Dispatched when a display object is about to be removed from the display list.
 * 
 * @event Event.REMOVED_FROM_STAGE			Dispatched when a display object is about to be removed from the display list, either
 * 											directly or through the removal of a sub tree in which the display object is contained.
 *
 * @event Event.ENTER_FRAME					[broadcast event] Dispatched when the playhead is entering a new frame.
 * 
 * @event Event.RENDER						[broadcast event] Dispatched when the display list is about to be updated and rendered.
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_MOVE				Dispatched when the user touches the device, and is continuously dispatched until the
 * 											point of contact is removed.
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_BEGIN			Dispatched when the user first contacts a touch-enabled device (such as touches a finger
 * 											to a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_END				Dispatched when the user removes contact with a touch-enabled device (such as lifts a
 * 											finger off a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_TAP				Dispatched when the user lifts the point of contact over the same DisplayObject instance
 * 											on which the contact was initiated on a touch-enabled device (such as presses and releases
 * 											a finger from a single point over a display object on a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_RELEASE_OUTSIDE	Dispatched when the user lifts the point of contact over the different DisplayObject
 * 											instance on which the contact was initiated on a touch-enabled device (such as presses and
 * 											releases a finger from a single point over a display object on a mobile phone or tablet
 * 											with a touch screen).
