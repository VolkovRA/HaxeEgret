 * 
 * @event Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE				Dispatched when a display object is added to the on stage display list, either

 * 
 * @event Event.REMOVED_FROM_STAGE			Dispatched when a display object is about to be removed from the display list, either

 * 											finger off a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_TAP				Dispatched when the user lifts the point of contact over the same DisplayObject instance
 * 											on which the contact was initiated on a touch-enabled device (such as presses and releases
 * 											a finger from a single point over a display object on a mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen).
 * 
 * @event TouchEvent.TOUCH_RELEASE_OUTSIDE	Dispatched when the user lifts the point of contact over the different DisplayObject
